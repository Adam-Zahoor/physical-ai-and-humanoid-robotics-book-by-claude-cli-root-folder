# Glossary: Introduction to Physical AI

## A

**Actuator**: A mechanical device that converts energy (typically electrical) into physical motion. In humanoid robots, actuators control joint movement and other mechanical functions.

## E

**Embodied Intelligence**: Intelligence that emerges when cognitive systems are integrated with physical bodies that interact with the real world. Unlike purely digital AI, embodied intelligence must operate under physical constraints.

**Embodiment**: The integration of cognitive processes with physical form, where the body and its interactions with the environment play a crucial role in shaping intelligent behavior.

## P

**Perception**: The process by which a robot interprets sensory information from its environment, including vision, touch, sound, and proprioception.

**Physical AI**: Artificial intelligence systems that operate within physical constraints and interact with the real world, as opposed to purely digital or virtual AI systems.

## R

**Robotics Middleware**: Software infrastructure that provides common services and communication protocols for robot applications, such as ROS (Robot Operating System).

## S

**Sensorimotor Integration**: The process by which sensory input and motor output are coordinated to produce purposeful action. A key component of embodied intelligence.

**Simulation-to-Real**: The process of transferring behaviors, algorithms, or knowledge learned in simulation to real-world physical systems.

## T

**Task Space**: The coordinate system describing the position and orientation of a robot's end-effector (e.g., hand or tool) in the environment.

## V

**Virtual vs. Physical AI**: Virtual AI operates in digital environments without physical constraints, while physical AI must operate within the laws of physics and real-world limitations.
